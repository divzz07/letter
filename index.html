              Awani, I love you more than words could ever express.** If I could gather every star in the sky, every drop in the ocean, and every heartbeat in the world, it still wouldn't be enough to match how much I love you. You are my everything—my greatest joy, my deepest love, and the most precious part of my life. No distance, no time, nothing in this world could ever change how much you mean to me. I’ll love you today, tomorrow, and for every lifetime to come
